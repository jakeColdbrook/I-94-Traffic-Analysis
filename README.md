# I-94 Traffic Westbound Traffic Analysis

The goal of this project to explore the causes of traffic on I-94 and to create easy to understand data visualizations for readers.

The data is from a traffic station roughly midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN, and can not be used to generalize as traffic conditions for all of I-94.

The dataset is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume
